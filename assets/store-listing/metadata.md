Stop guessing if your RDP connection is frozen.

RDP Heartbeat places a subtle, unobtrusive "breathing" light on your remote desktop screen. It serves as a simple visual cue:
• If the light is pulsing: Your connection is alive and streaming.
• If the light freezes: Your RDP connection has stalled.

We've all been there: waiting for a long compilation or AI task, and the screen sits perfectly still. Is the tool thinking, or did the network drop? RDP Heartbeat gives you the answer instantly, saving your sanity.

KEY FEATURES:

• Visual Heartbeat: A smooth, pulsing dot that confirms your display stream is active.

• Start on Boot: Supports starting automatically with Windows, so you can set it and forget it. (New in v1.1)

• Unobtrusive Design: "Always on Top" ensures visibility, while "Click-through" mode prevents it from blocking your mouse clicks.

• Highly Customizable:
   - Color: Match your wallpaper or preference.
   - Size & Opacity: Adjust from a tiny transparent dot to a clear indicator.
   - Position: Drag and drop it anywhere on your screen.

• Localized Interface: Fully supports English and Simplified Chinese.

• System Tray Support: Minimizes quietly to the tray for a clutter-free experience.

Created to make remote work a little less stressful.
